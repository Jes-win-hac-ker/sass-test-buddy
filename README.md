## Project Description
Our project roasts you based on your selections.  
You answer weird, unexpected questions, and our AI delivers brutally honest (and hilarious) responses.  

---

## The Problem (that doesnâ€™t exist)
People take boring, repetitive personality quizzes that give sugar-coated, predictable answers.  
Whereâ€™s the spice? Whereâ€™s the drama? Whereâ€™s the emotional damage?  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a quiz that doesnâ€™t care about your feelings. Pick your answers, and brace yourself.  
Every result is AI-powered, sarcastic, and impossible to forget.
